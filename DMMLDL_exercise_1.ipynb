        "Megacorp Ltd produces microprocessors. In the past, the manufacturer has used an expensive but extremely reliable diagnostic procedure to test if a microprocessor has a defect. Historical data shows that 80% of the processors coming out of the production line have a defect and are thus not usable. In order to cut costs, management is considering using a new test that is very inexpensive but not as reliable. Preliminary data suggest that if a microprocessor has a defect, then the probability that the new test declares that the microprocessor does not have a defect is 20%. If the microprocessor is working properly, then the test declares it does not have a defect with a 95% probability.\n",
        "Help the management at Megacorp to decide on deploying the new test by answering the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "> a) What is the probability that the new test declares that a randomly selected processor does not have a defect (i.e., what is the share of processor pass the new test)?\n",

        "> b) What is a probability that a processor that passed the new test (and would thus be shipped to a customer) has a defect?\n",
